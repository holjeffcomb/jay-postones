    heading: "BEST INVESTMENT IN MY DRUMMING",
    quote: `As a self-taught drummer, the hardest question for me had always been "What's next?". Usually, it was just learning to cover another song, but that wasn't leading to any real growth.\n\nJay's masterclass was the perfect solution.\n\nHis lessons are down to earth, easy to follow, and structured in a way that drummers of all skill levels can tackle the material. You'll learn the importance of an actual practice routine, and how to identify gaps in your playing so you can improve efficiently.\n\nJay demonstrates that even the most complicated grooves can be broken down into fundamentals that can be mastered with some focus and discipline.\n\nIf you're looking for real guidance from a world-class drummer, this is perfect for you.`,

    heading: "JAY’S LESSONS KICKED ME INTO GEAR",
    quote: `I’ve been playing on and off for a long time, and I felt confident in my coordination and ability to navigate odd time signatures, but I was ultimately feeling directionless. I would sit down at the kit and just not know what to play.\n\nJay’s lessons really kicked me into gear! Jay challenged me with some crazy polyrhythms and coordination exercises and gave me a lot of patterns to use in grooves and fills. I feel like my vocabulary, coordination, speed, and overall comfort level on the kit have all dramatically improved.\n\nI really liked the format for remote lessons – They were very clearly explained and followed a logical progression without huge leaps.\n\nThis was a fantastic experience, and I’d recommend it to anyone who wants to take their drumming to the next level.`,

    quote: `One month in and I’m already feeling more confident with limb independence and technique.\n\nI’ve played varying genres from classic rock and metal to reggae, but the intricacies of prog drumming have always given me my biggest challenge. I purchased the sheet music for TesseracT’s “Luminary” years back and had some luck learning enough of it, but this website brings a whole new level to drum education.\n\nJay breaks down incredibly complex segments into easy-to-digest sections and builds you up until the pieces fit together. Between the multiple camera angles, scrolling sheet music, and customizable tempo, there’s a combination suited for everyone.\n\nThis website is as close to in-person instruction from an industry pro as you can get. If you own drumsticks, I recommend signing up!`,

    heading: "JAY UNLOCKED THE GROOVE WITHIN ME",
    quote: `Jay’s masterclass reset the bar on my journey completely. I joined Jay's Masterclass in 2022 and absolutely loved the experience. Jay was meticulous by starting with the fundamentals such as grip and posture before moving into advanced concepts.\n\nThere were times I’d look at Jay’s lesson and think “There’s no way in hell I’ll be able to play that.” The way he breaks down each concept, each fill, and each hit, makes any complex beat totally approachable.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the class is not just learning cool rhythms, but learning HOW to learn. Jay covers working with a metronome at slow tempos to build up skills, programming ideas to assemble unique rhythms, and how to combine simple concepts into progressions that sounded masterful.\n\nI started drumming in a band a year ago and I find myself playing with SO much confidence now. He unlocked the groove within me and I’m so excited to see where it goes from here!`,

    quote: `I've been a drummer for 20+ years and always had an interest in progressive drumming. For some reason, I couldn't find an easy A-to-Z lesson plan covering everything I wanted to learn. Then I came across Jay's Masterclass and decided to give it a go.\n\nSo far I am much more versed in odd time, polyrhythms, stick control, double bass & independence. Internal timing is the one area I feel I've improved the most.\n\nHis lessons are concise and very easy to follow, not overwhelming. If you want to take your drumming to the next level, go for it!`,
